# Realism

The target is the gameplay mockups: photoreal, present-day, somewhere in the Carolinas or Florida. This
document is the honest ledger against that target — what the code reaches on its own, what it cannot
reach without the Unreal editor, and what is deliberately not being attempted.

It exists because a milestone that says "realism: done" is worth nothing. Each line below is either
backed by a test, or named as a gap.

## What the simulation produces on its own

All of this is generated from the state data and verified by the CMake test suite, with no engine
involved. The offline renderer in the scratchpad draws it to check that the numbers add up to a picture.

| | Where | Checked by |
|---|---|---|
| Real geography: coastline, rivers, lakes, sounds, mountains | `Sim/StatePlan` | `TestState` — towns on land, non-overlapping, coast where it belongs |
| Roads that are cut and filled, not draped over hills | `StatePlan::GradeHighways` | every road in every state at or under 6% |
| Bridges and overpasses with their own deck profiles | `StatePlan::ComputeDecks` | roads never buried, never in the water |
| Trees and brush by species, placed by coast, elevation and water | `Sim/Vegetation` | `TestVegetation` — stable in world space, off the road, out of town, species suit the ground |
| Road paint to the US convention | `Sim/RoadMarkings` | `TestMarkings` — on the pavement along its whole length, yellow and white mean what they mean |
| Towns with a road grid, lots, and a role for every building | `Sim/CityLayout` | `check_services.py` — every building offers something |
| Weather, time of day, rain geometry, thunder | `Sim/Clock`, `Game/DTGWeatherFx` | verified by offline rasterisation |
| Engine note from crank layout and fitted parts | `Sim/EngineAudio` | `docs/AUDIO.md` |

### Vegetation

Longleaf and loblolly pine inland, live oak through the older country and the towns, cabbage palm and
palmetto within about a kilometre of the coast, bald cypress where there is standing water within a short
walk, and scrub where the ground is steep or thin. Nothing grows on a carriageway, in open water, or on a
town street — only the parks are planted inside a town.

The placement is deterministic in world space rather than per chunk. This matters more than it sounds:
terrain streams in chunks that are built, released and built again as the player drives, so anything
keyed to the chunk would shift every time you drove past it. `TestVegetation` asks for the same ground
twice and in four overlapping pieces and requires the same trees back.

Cost is about 23 plants per chunk in South Carolina, 43 in Florida and 70 in North Carolina — roughly
1,300 to 3,400 triangles — at 0.7 to 1.4 ms to choose and 0.1 ms to build.

### Road paint

Yellow separates traffic going opposite ways and white separates traffic going the same way, which is the
thing a player who drives these roads every day would notice first if it were wrong. An undivided highway
gets a double yellow centre, white edge lines and broken white lane lines; a divided one gets no yellow
down the middle at all — a yellow left edge on each carriageway, white on the right. Town junctions get
crosswalk ladders and stop bars.

Stripes break only where the road's own polyline bends or its deck changes slope, so a straight run is a
single quad. That is 29,498 stripes and 4.9 ms for North Carolina rather than 144,274 and 20.4 ms, with
a 120 m cap so no triangle is so large that it never frustum-culls.

## What needs the editor

None of the following can be faked in C++, and attempting to would produce something that looks worse
than honest flat shading. Each needs a person in the Unreal editor with assets.

**Materials.** Everything in the world is currently drawn with a single vertex-colour material. There is
no asphalt, no bark, no leaf translucency, no painted metal, no glass, no wet-road reflection. This is the
single largest gap between the current build and the mockups, and it is the one with the best return:
the geometry underneath is already correct, so a PBR material set would move the whole world a long way
in one step. Needed: base colour, roughness, normal and (for foliage) subsurface maps for asphalt,
concrete, brick, siding, glass, car paint, bark, and leaf cards.

**Lighting.** Lumen GI and reflections, a sky atmosphere driven by the existing time-of-day clock, and
volumetric fog for the morning haze the mockups lean on. The simulation already produces sun angle and
weather state; nothing consumes them for lighting yet.

**Nanite and foliage instancing.** Trees are procedural meshes built per chunk. That is affordable now
because there are tens per chunk, not thousands. Real forest density needs
`UHierarchicalInstancedStaticMeshComponent` with proper LODs and wind, which needs tree assets.

**Vehicle art.** Cars are built from tapered boxes. The chassis simulation, the engine audio and the
tuning are all real; the shells are placeholders. Needs modelled bodies with glass, lights, grille,
badges and interiors.

**Character art.** Pedestrians and the player are capsules with simple meshes. Needs skeletal meshes and
animation sets — idle, walk, run, enter and exit a vehicle, and the conversation poses the NPC minds
already drive.

**Audio mixing.** The engine note is synthesised and correct. Tyre noise, wind, impacts, ambience and
the attenuation and reverb settings around them are editor work.

## Deliberately not attempted

- **Real brands.** Imitation makes and models only, as the brief asks. No real logos or badges.
- **Photogrammetry or scanned terrain.** The map is real geography at a compressed scale — real place
  names and real relative positions, not real elevation data.
- **Superelevation.** Carriageways are flat in cross-section; roads are not banked through curves. The
  paint and the deck assume this, so banking would mean changing both.
- **A physical median.** A divided highway is one graded ribbon with a painted median rather than two
  separate carriageways with a gap. At the map's compressed scale, two carriageways with a true median
  would be wider than the towns they pass.

## How this is checked without an engine

Three things, in increasing cost:

1. **The CMake test suite** (111 tests). Geometry, placement rules, determinism, conventions, budgets.
2. **Offline rasterisation.** A software renderer in the scratchpad draws the world's own data from a
   driver's eye. This is how the vegetation and the paint were checked, and it is why the renderer is
   worth keeping: it caught that the terrain and the planting agreed, and it is the only thing that
   answers "does this look like the Southeast".
3. **Mutation testing.** Every new test above was confirmed by breaking the thing it guards and watching
   it fail. A test that has never been seen to fail is not evidence of anything.

What none of this checks is how the world looks *in Unreal*, because the engine layer has never been
compiled by an engine. `Tests/check_headers.py` catches the one class of error that bit repeatedly —
unqualified `dtg::sim` names in engine headers — but the first real build will find more.
